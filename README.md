# LianaTech-RecruitmentDemo
This project is going to be a Recruitment Demo for the main page of Liana Technology company.

the main part of this project is written by HTML and CSS and some JavaScript code is added to make it more dynamic.
At the beginning of the webpage a parallax component is created and this component is responsive for all devices.
The latest news section is created and uses the RSS feed from https://www.lianatech.com/blog.rss
for the Newsletter subscription section email validation is implemented and after submitting the thank you notification is popping up as a javascript alert.
also, you can not submit the empty field.
for Clients, Employees, and Users sections animated numbers are implemented and when you refresh the page they start to count until they reach the specified numbers.

you can see the demo of the web page with the link below:
